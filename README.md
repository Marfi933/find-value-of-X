# find-value-of-X

# Problem:
  input: string, which contains a numbers and a char
  output: sum of numbers of left side equals to number of the right side, or throws an exception
  There are some classes. If you use ThreadBruteForce class, then the class generates combination of numbers using Threads. It's faster...
  
# Implementation information:
  Class works only with operator '+';
  Every method of the class has a documentation, how to use;
  In string you can use char (you cant use digit variable) whatevery you want, but the variable has to be same in every occurenties;
